    <h1>KNN and Logistic Regression Models</h1>
    <p>This repository contains the implementation of KNN and Logistic Regression models in Python. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of these two machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.</p>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>To run the code in this repository, you will need the following packages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>numpy</li>
      <li>pandas</li>
      <li>scikit-learn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can install these packages using the following command:</p>
    <pre>
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    </pre>
    <h2>KNN Model</h2>
    <p>The KNN model is a simple machine learning algorithm that uses the nearest neighbors of a data point to make predictions. In this project, the KNN model is implemented using the <code>KNeighborsClassifier</code> class from the <code>scikit-learn</code> library.</p>
    <h2>Logistic Regression Model</h2>
    <p>The Logistic Regression model is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. In this project, the Logistic Regression model is implemented using the <code>LogisticRegression</code> class from the <code>scikit-learn</code> library.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To use the models, simply run the following command:</p>
    <pre>
python knn_and_logistic_regression.py
    </pre>
    <p>This will load the sample data, train the KNN and Logistic Regression models, and evaluate their performance on the test data.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrates the use of KNN and Logistic Regression models for classification tasks. Both models are implemented using the <code>scikit-learn</code> library, which provides a simple and efficient way to build machine learning models in Python. The results show that both models can be used for classification tasks, but the Logistic Regression model generally performs better than the KNN model.</p>
